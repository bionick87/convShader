# ConvShader: Convolution Network in the Mobile GPU (in the 2014) with OpenGL ES 2.0 shading language



![](img/fig.png)


A first attempt at an embedded implementation of a Convolution Neural Network in 2014. 


Particularly, to check the speed in Gflops/s for a Mobile GPU Adreno 320 in the Samsung Galaxy S4 through a filter bank 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, 9x9. It has been successfully performed in Samsung GALAXY S4 with Android 4.3.
