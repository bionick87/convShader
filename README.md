Convolution in the Mobile GPU with OpenGL ES 2.0 shading language

This code was created in collaboration with E-Lab at Purdue University (https://engineering.purdue.edu/elab/blog/) to check the speed in Gflops/s for a Mobile GPU Adreno 320 in the Samsung Galaxy S4 through a filter bank 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, 9x9. It has been successfully performed in Samsung GALAXY S4 with Andorid 4.3.
